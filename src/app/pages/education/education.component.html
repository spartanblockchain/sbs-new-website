                </h3>
                <p class="hidden" style="text-align: center">(<i>noun</i>)</p>
                <p class="hidden">A digitized, decentralized ledger of transactions. A blockchain is constantly growing as ‘completed’ blocks (the most recent transactions) are recorded and added to it in chronological order. It allows market participants to keep track
                    of transactions without centralized record-keeping strategies. Each node (a computer connected to the network) gets a copy of the blockchain, which is continually downloaded automatically.

                <p class="hidden" style="text-align: center">(<i>noun</i>)</p>
                <p class="hidden">Any form of currency that only exists digitally, that usually has no central issuing or regulating authority but instead uses a decentralized blockchain-based system to record transactions and manage the issuance of new units. Relies on
                    cryptography to prevent counterfeiting and fraudulent transactions. The first real-world application of blockchain technology was Bitcoin.</p>
